	- Install the latest Fabric Samples and binaries (curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s)
	- Find the scripts to bring up the network in the test-network directory of the fabric-samples repository.
	 Navigate to the test network directory by using the following command:
	 cd fabric-samples/fabcar
	- From inside the fabcar directory, run the following command to remove any containers or artifacts from any previous runs:
		./network.sh down
	- You can then bring up the network by issuing the following command. You will experience problems if you try to run the script from another directory:

	- Copy the javascript folder and named it apiserver
	- Create a new file in apiserver folder as apiserver.js

	- Start the network in fabcar like ./startFabric.sh javascript
	- Enroll Admin like node enrollAdmin.js
	- Enroll User like node registerUser.js 
	- Run the apiserver.js file like nodemon apiserver.js
	- Run command curl http://localhost:8080 or 8081/api/queryallcars

		-sudo chmod 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs/
	- Create your project directory from the command line and provide permission:
		- sudo mkdir /opt/lampp/htdocs/your_project
		- sudo chown $USER:webuser /opt/lampp/htdocs/your_project
		- sudo chmod 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs/your_project
		- sudo â€“R 777 /opt/lampp/htdocs/your_project
